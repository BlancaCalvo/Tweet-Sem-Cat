Semantically-Annotated Tweets in Catalan

The present project is part of the course on Language Resources from the Master in Language Analysis and Processing of the EHU, and aims at creating a semantically-annotated corpus in Catalan. The corpus is comprised of 50 tweets which are annotated following the guidelines from PropBank and AnCora on argument annotation. Having analysed the particular characteristics of the dataset, we set additional guidelines to account for the particularities of tweets.
